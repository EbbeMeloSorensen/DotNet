Done:
* Make the Visual Studio console application read data from a sqlite data file generated by the vs code application (OK)
  (notice that it works even when the database has more columns than the one generated by the Visual Studio project)
* Figure out if your Heroku application still runs (OK)
  (it does - on https://meloreactivities.herokuapp.com)
* Make the API target a local postgres database

Todo:
* 
* Implement support for exporting the database contents to a file
* Implement support for importing a file to the database
